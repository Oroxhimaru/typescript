9. prmitive types copy by value and reference types copy by reference.
10. prmitive types are stored in stack and reference types are stored in heap.
11. difference between array and tuple is that array can store any type of data but tuple can store only specific type of data.
12. enum / enumeration is a way to define a set of named constants. 
13. Any in typescript is a type that can be any type of data.
14. unknown is a type that can be any type of data but it is not assignable to any other type.

23. interface is a way to define a type of object. 
24. also in interface you can't add new properties to the object. otherwise it will throw an error. you need to describe the new properties in the interface. also we can make new  property opitional by adding ? after the property name.
25. extending interface is a way to extend the interface, means using the other interface in the current interface.
26. two interface of same  name can be merged.
